## Abstract
<a align="docs/images/pipeline.png"><img src="assets/pipeline.png"></a>
______

Automatic Emergency Braking (AEB) systems are a crucial component in ensuring the safety of passengers in autonomous vehicles. Conventional AEB systems primarily rely on closed-set perception modules to recognize traffic conditions and assess collision risks. To enhance the adaptability of AEB systems in open scenarios, we propose Dual-AEB, a system combines an advanced multimodal large language model (MLLM) for comprehensive scene understanding and a conventional rule-based rapid AEB to ensure quick response times. To the best of our knowledge, Dual-AEB is the first method to incorporate MLLMs within AEB systems. Through extensive experimentation, we have validated the effectiveness of our method.
